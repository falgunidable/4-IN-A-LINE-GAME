- Requirements considered, before starting with the actual programming of the game:

Canvas - This object represents a background entity on which you place interface items, such as check boxes, radio groups, and text items.
Panel – a particular arrangement of information grouped together for presentation to users in a window or pop-up view.
Window - A window is a container for all visual objects that make up a Form Builder application, including canvas. A single form can include n number of windows.
Movement of one window to another is called activity movement, which will be implemented in the code.
