On the verge of making 4 IN A LINE game
                                                                                         
Description:
This game is played on a vertical board which has seven hollow columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides, when talked about the physical board.  Basically it is a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns. Both players get a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different color. The board is empty at the start of the game.

Objective:
The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Before starting, players decide randomly which of them will be the beginner; moves are made alternatively, one by turn.
Moves alight in placing new pieces on the board, pieces slide downwards from upper holes, falling down to the last row or piling up on the last piece introduced in the same column. So, in every turn the introduced piece may be placed at most on seven different squares. The winner is the first player who gets a straight line made with four own pieces and no gaps between them.

Game which is going to be made:
•	4 IN A ROW will come with a grid
•	2 End Supports
•	21 Red Checkers And 21 Black Checkers

RULES OF THE GAME:
-	The game rules for 4 IN A ROW are just as simple as the directions for play. Since only one checker can be placed in the board at a time and all of the slots are divided into rows and columns, it’s not possible to cheat and move a checker once it has been placed. Checkers in the board may not be manipulated. Each player may drop only one checker into the grid per turn.
-	A winner is declared when one player gets four of their colored checkers in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Other configurations, such as squares, don’t count as winning combinations. The game is declared a stalemate or tie if all the pieces are played but nobody has four in a row.
-	Divide the checkers evenly between players. The classic colors are red and black, but other variations include red and yellow and black and white.
-	Determine which player goes first. This may be done using any random method, such as flipping a coin. It’s common to let the youngest player go first when playing with children.
-	The first player inserts a checker into the grid. Only after the checker has been released can the second player make his or her move.
-	Turns continue to alternate between the first and second players until someone gets four checkers of the same color lined up in a row and he is the winner. 
-	When the board is filled with both colored checkers, without any winning moves, it’s a draw.
-	After a winner has been determined or a tie declared, the grid is reset to its original grid, which is to blank.
